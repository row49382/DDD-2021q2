- Do a DDD using any/all of the following:​
  - DDD Diagrams in UML/MS/C4 Notation ​
  - Classes, Enums, etc. e.g. classes and namespaces ​
  - SQL or other schema that represents the mapping of DDD to storage​
  - As you work through the problem, PR the instructors​
  - We’ll provide feedback, and ultimately CE Credits​
